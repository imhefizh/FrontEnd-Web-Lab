## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Media Query

### What I learned

1. I went from Tailwind before Vanilla CSS. So, I have to adapt how to write several styles on Vanilla CSS. Including how hover and focus work, grid, smooth animation, and media queries.
2. Suprisingly, a space before `:hover` or `:focus` could affect how it works. If we add one spacing before it, it would give the effect of it to the child elements.

### Useful resources

- Github Copilot - It really helped me for understanding specific problem.
- [Tailwind Doc](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/aspect-ratio) - For me checking how some styles works in Vanilla CSS
