## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries

### What I learned

1. Apparently, I can set rem value by setting up font-size on html selector
2. Apparently, body element is not in `relative` position by default, it's in `static` position
3. `clamp()` is very useful for managing `font-size` property. I can set the minimal, ideal, and maximal value on it.
4. Apparently, I can use `font` property to set all I need for the font. So I combine it with CSS Variable value like `400 1rem "Inter", Arial;`. More efficient. Then, just overwrite the size with `font-size`.
5. Considering `list-style-position` property, either it's `inside` or `outside` is tricky when facing margin or padding. I did it on `outside` value and leverage `margin-left` property for setting up the left margin from the bullet.

### Useful resources

- Github Copilot - It really helped me for understanding specific problem.
- [Tailwind Doc](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/aspect-ratio) - For me checking how some styles works in Vanilla CSS
