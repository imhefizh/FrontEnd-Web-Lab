## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. Apparently, I could use `data-` attribute on button element to assign a value onto it.
2. I tried to implement MVC approach for the Javascript
3. Apparently, I could use `id` attribute immediately to search an element in HTMl Collection instead of an index.
4. Using `focus-within` pseudo-class on an element to get focus effect from it's child in CSS
5. Apparently, `onChange` in react and `onchange` in Vanilla JS have different behavior.
6. Implement state hidration on JS with my own `render()` function.
7. Apparently, HTML Collections behaves different with Array.

### Useful resources

- Github Copilot - It really helped me for understanding specific problem.
- [Tailwind Doc](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/aspect-ratio) - For me checking how some styles works in Vanilla CSS
