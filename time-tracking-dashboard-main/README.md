## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. Apparently, I could utilize `filter` attribute with `brightness()` value on CSS to give brighter color effect on hover
2. Apparently, `user-select: none` still not working in tablet. I don't know what exatly the cause, maybe it's just my browser which is I do the development in Microsoft Edge.
3. Using icon-kit from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), it's indeed easier and versatile.
4. Implementing data populating and state management with only Vanilla Javascript (I used to do it with React. It's indeed easier with React, but doing it with just only javascript gave me more insight how state work underhood)

### Useful resources

- Github Copilot - It really helped me for understanding specific problem.
- [Tailwind Doc](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/aspect-ratio) - For me checking how some styles works in Vanilla CSS
