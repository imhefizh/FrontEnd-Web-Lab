## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

1. Suprisingly, `<body>` element has it's own default margin by 8px on Microsoft Edge. Thus, I have to set it's margin to 0px for consistency.
2. `calc()` function is very hepful when I need to apply math especially on width and height of an element.
3. I'm a person who start from Tailwind firstly before Vanilla CSS, so it is a new insight for me that `text-wrap` apparently is `white-space`.
4. I just knew that `font-family` doesn't work if I don't provide callback font as it's second choice, or maybe it's just on my browser..I don't know.

### Useful resources

- Github Copilot - It really helped me for understanding specific problem.
