## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Modular stylesheets
- CSS Path-clip

### What I learned

1. Apparently, `id` prop of an HTML element can't accept more than one argument.
2. Separating CSS resetter to external css file for modulariy. And I implemented this method for breakpoints as well, for mudularity and easy maintaining.
3. Importing `main.js` through `<head>` element with `defer` attribute for async file loading.

### Useful resources

- Github Copilot - It really helped me for understanding specific problem.
- [Tailwind Doc](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/aspect-ratio) - For me checking how some styles works in Vanilla CSS
