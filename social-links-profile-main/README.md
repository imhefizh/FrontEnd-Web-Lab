## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Animation on Hover and Focus

### What I learned

1. Nothing new. Just practicing flexbox, grid, and animation. Ah, just discovering new fact that we can't extract value from another attribute on other elements, I was wanting to use width value from another element's style. Or it's just skill issue? Please let me know.
2. I need a tool to check my missing type on CSS. I was confused a little bit when my animation didn't work just because I miss the `s` after the `duration` on transition `attribute`.

### Useful resources

- Github Copilot - It really helped me for understanding specific problem.
- [Tailwind Doc](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/aspect-ratio) - For me checking how some styles works in Vanilla CSS
