## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. An element can achieves more than one class value by separating the value with space like this `class="card card-1"`. So it has two selector which are `card` and `card-1`.
2. Writing span in CSS Grid which the syntax is `grid-column=1/3`, means start from line 1 and end on line 3, taking 2 column visually. The same way for rows with `grid-row` property.

### Useful resources

- Github Copilot - It really helped me for understanding specific problem.
- [Tailwind Doc](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/aspect-ratio) - For me checking how some styles works in Vanilla CSS
